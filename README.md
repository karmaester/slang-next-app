## Considerations for future implementations

- Responsiveness for horizontal display in mobile.
- I18n directory structure with JSON files per language, making available avatar feedback in different languages (a useTranslation hook or a language select to implement).
- Animation for characters takes the correct place during response feedback.
- Animation for the audio play button, to be filled according to the audio‚Äôs duration (this would require receiving the value in the same request for a new word and using it as a param in that transition).
- Audio‚Äôs actual representation instead of the sound-wave.png (with Sass and the knowledge of audios volume per 500ms as values in an array).
- A ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù button or ‚Äú?‚Äù icon leads to an ‚Äúabout‚Äù page for the app to self-document.
- If allowed to persist data:
    - isNewUser and usersLastUpdate to customize the welcoming message.
    - Save failed attempts to be replayed.
- Provide Gaby with mouth modulation.
- Other avatars could serve to generate storytelling exercises.
- Better chosen messages result from user testing.
- Add a ‚Äúservice unavailable‚Äù notice if uptime is untrusted (the current demo API shuts off at night).
- Create an animated checkmark for correct answers.
- Share button to print the record of continuous correct answers and share it as an URL.
- Add unitary and integration testing with jest, cypress, and react-testing-library.
- Elaborate on the implemented libraries in the readme file.
- Include sound effects on correct and incorrect answers.
- For demanding users just like myself, I would add a dark theme.
 
The idea behind creating it as a PWA is that the user can install it on a device, so it can be seen and used often.

Having an avatar as a companion gives the app its own personality, which may result in the user connecting with it (this is a hypothesis that should be validated with user testing).

As SEO practices, I would pay close attention to:
- Time on page.
- Click through rate.
- User‚Äôs behavior on each screen.
- Topical authority status according to google‚Äôs algorithm.
- Largest contentful paint < 2.5s (with image and script optimization).
- First imput delay < 100ms.
- Cumulative layout shift > 0.1.

There are no instructions regarding the score, that is done on purpose so when the user sends a correct answer and the streak changes or an incorrect answer sets it back to 0 it explains itself, which should lead the user to set a goal for higher streaks (this is also a hypothesis that should be confirmed or discarded).
